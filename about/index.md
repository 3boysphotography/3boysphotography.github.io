3 Boys Photography is a portrait photography business located in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania that specializes in family and children's portraits.

Many people ask me what's with the name - 3 Boys Photography? So here it goes. I'm the father of three amazing boys. They are the reason I picked up my first camera, and they provide me with incredible inspiration and happiness. I also have an amazing wife that was instrumental in providing me with three boys!

I love capturing the bond between families. There's something magical about seeing a child smile at their mother, or a father reach for their baby, or siblings interacting - one minute fighting and the next minute laughing. 

My style is considered lifesytle family photography. I love capturing a family as they truly are with a combination of candid portraits mixed in with some posed portraits. Even the posed portraits will capture personality, meaning, and will help to tell a story.

I look forward to meeting you, photographing your lives, and capturing those moments you never want to forget.
