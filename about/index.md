3 Boys Photography is a portrait photography business located in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania that specializes in family and children's portraits.

Many people ask me what's with the name - 3 Boys Photography? So here it goes. I'm the father of three boys. They are the reason I picked up my first camera, and they provide me with incredible inspiration and happiness. 

My photography style is a combination of candid portraits mixed in with some posed portraits. I love capturing the bond between families. There's something magical about seeing a child smile at their mother, or a father reach for their baby, or siblings interacting - one minute fighting and the next minute laughing. My goal with every session is to provide a fun, relaxing environment with portraits that show personality, meaning, and help to tell a story.

I look forward to meeting you, photographing your lives, and capturing those moments you never want to forget.
